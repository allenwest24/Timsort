In this experiment I implemented and timed some sorting algorithms, including Timsort in C++.

# Timsort

In this experiment I implemented and timed insertion sort, mergesort, and Timsort on a set of [data.txt](./data.txt) in [sort.cpp](./sort.cpp). 

You can compile with: `g++ -std=c++14 sort.cpp -o sort`
